    <h1>Netigen Students are Highly Concerned if ISRT Authority knows about the Existence of AI</h1>
    </div>
    <p>Devin AI just automated every analyst job, while academia’s finest still cite ‘Breast-Fed Child Concerned Researches.’ Meanwhile, students rebranded us as the Scamstitute of Scamstical Torture—thanks to ‘Applied Data Science’ being 0% applied, 100% existential crisis. Biostat isn’t a field; it’s the air you’re forced to breathe. Congrats, your personality is now ‘peer-reviewed.</p>
    <p>LLMs took over, but students still call it the Scamstitute of Scamstical Torture—scammed by 'Applied Data Science' (0% applied, 100% despair). Biostat isn’t a subject, it’s Stockholm Syndrome. Academia? Congrats, your personality is now ‘H-index victim.</p>

    <p>BRACU’s AI kids are playing Fullstack Hunger Games while we’re still stuck in DU’s year system – academia’s version of a government job. ISRT culture? Salam counts at all-time lows, seniors too burnt out to haze, and 8-to-5 classes turned us into math-wage slaves. Pvt unis get GPT-5; we get chalkboard relics and a ‘R > Python’ cult (ML here means Memorized Lectures). Finally installing pandas… in 2030.

        <p>Forget AI—your core curriculum features mandatory peasant cosplay and statistical trauma bonding in Biostats. Who needs TensorFlow when you’ve mastered the ancient art of syllabus necromancy?
           Who needs hackathons when you can perfect your forced-cultural-performance resume? But rejoice! The stats department finally spawned a Biostats PhD—just as Grameen and Banglalink dissolved from waiting for a seminar offer. Progress!
        And if you survived Pitha Utshob’s logistical hell? Congrats. You’re now ripe for students' club hazing—the only applied leadership experience this uni offers is to tolerate inexperienced losers losing mind at you for their own mismanagement.
