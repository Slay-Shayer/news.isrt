    <h1>Netigen Students are Highly Concerned if ISRT Authority knows about the Existence of AI</h1>
    </div>
    <p>Devin AI just proved web, software, and data analyst roles are basically obsolete. While industries demand AI-powered talent, our department's finest minds are still furiously trying to score ResearchGate citations for "breast-fed child concerned researches"—the kind of groundbreaking work modern mothers solved a decade ago. Priorities, people.</p>
    <p>In the era of LLMs and NLP, students are stuck calling it the Scamstitute of Scamstical Research and Torture — scammed twice with the words “Applied” and “Data Science.” Biostat is in the air, and you breathe it not by choice, but because free will was deleted. Academia? Yeah, that’s your only personality now.</p>

    <p>Imagine rocking a year system in 2025 while BRACU kids are casually building AI agents for sport — and here we are, crying about DU admin and then just... moving on like it’s tradition. Speaking of traditions — ISRT culture is in shambles. Salam counts are hitting all-time lows, and immediates can’t even bully the fresh meat properly thanks to the 8-to-5 class grind. It’s like a 9-to-5 unpaid internship, but with more math-induced trauma.</p>
